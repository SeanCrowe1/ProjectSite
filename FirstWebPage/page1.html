		<p>"Waterfalls" is a song by American girl group TLC, released on May 29, 1995, by LaFace and Arista as the third single from the group's second album, CrazySexyCool (1994). The song addresses the illegal drug trade, promiscuity, and HIV/AIDS. "Waterfalls" was the first number-one song to refer to AIDS, according to BMG's Jarett E. Nolan</p>
